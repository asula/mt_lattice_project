we cannot rise adequately to the daily challenges , or even to the annual challenges except with difficulty .
we call for human rights and freedoms in Tibet as much as in China , where so many are jailed just for daring to express their views - like Hu Jia , just after he spoke to us here in Parliament last November .
I am also talking about developing cooperation with the Council of Europe on training mediators from the Roma community .
the EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses , and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future .
we have just heard the Council making a real plea about the way the Member States have to go ahead by putting this in the mainstream of their policies .
as I recall , Ceaucşescu &apos;s Romania was a country without debt , as is North Korea .
Parliament &apos;s 2010 draft budget found resources of EUR 25 million , which will enable it to launch the programme at the very start of 2010 , and it was able to find these resources without touching the Progress programme in 2010 .
however , when we look towards Asia , we should also take Japan into consideration .
this challenge will continue to grow as the world &apos;s population expands .
the report provides guidelines which will help facilitate the transition from the current to the new procedure resulting from the Lisbon Treaty .
secondly , this somehow forges a link between the European Union and what is happening in Europe as a whole , and hence with the countries of the Council of Europe .
in Sweden alone , with a population of nine million , 380 women are abused every day .
in our group there are also two attitudes to the Galileo project .
absolutely .
I am absolutely convinced that if we are able to do so , it will not be in the context of the regulation that we are debating today , but rather under the auspices of the project for which Mrs Muscardini is responsible .
Mr Barroso , I believe you when you say that you want a tax on financial transactions or on financial activities .
we eagerly await your thoughts on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and the significance of this dialogue for peace and international understanding which you will share with us today in the plenary of the European Parliament .
nevertheless , we need to continue to provide assistance and help the reconstruction of the affected regions in Georgia , support confidence-building measures , as well as the development of regional cooperation .
for these reasons , I voted against this report in the final vote .
against the background of the recent migratory pressure from North Africa , the strengthening of Frontex has become a high priority for the Council .
the relevant question is no longer whether it needs debt forgiveness , but when .
I consider the proposed increase unjustified and excessive .
it is simply not serious to put that argument forward .
like our European partners , all Bulgarian citizens must show greater resolve and decisiveness in fighting corruption and organised crime , and in securing reliable , effective controls over how European funds are used .
for the victims of the Holodomor there can be no better tribute than the creation of a prosperous , stable and democratic Ukraine , founded on solid institutions and on an engaged civil society .
as emphasised in every report in which Parliament approves EGF funding , claims on the structural funds should not be used in place of measures for which businesses themselves are responsible according to the collective agreements .
( RO ) Mr President , the coup d &apos;état which took place in March 2009 has been followed by acts of violence , human rights violations , including the random arrest of opposition leaders , and internal insecurity .
( the order of business was thus established .. )
firstly , I would ask our Commissioner to convey the concern resounding today to the Ministers for the Interior .
Parliament has approved the Commission &apos;s budget spending for 2009 , having obtained undertakings aimed at giving Member States more responsibility and improving control by national authorities of Union expenditure .
yet only 15 years ago there seems to have been the potential for Madagascar to be so different .
the report on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport aims to establish passenger protection rights , applicable across the entire Union , for all passengers and for various forms of transport .
migrants will continue to come to Europe as long as they believe that the financial benefits they can gain from working illegally outweigh the risks of being arrested by European law enforcement bodies .
we need a well-balanced middle path which ensures that we and our planet can continue to thrive in the future .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , wanting a recovery plan is a good intention .
finally , I am happy with the role played by employers and employees in improving health and safety conditions for workers .
toys should not become toxic traps for children .
with an additional 52 000 tonnes , there will be 285 000 tonnes within the tariff rate quota , so there will still be scope for 15 000 tonnes of imports under the usual erga omnes regime .
this is the reason that brings us here today .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent comments earlier on .
to conclude , Mr President , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and other colleagues for their excellent cooperation .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I am afraid I cannot resist .
this would have a negative impact on the freedom of access to the countryside , which is an important part of the everyday life of people in a country like Sweden .
in writing . - ( FR ) I welcome the firm stance our House took today in relation to a situation that has existed in Tibet for decades but deteriorated significantly a month ago .
this crisis shows that we should stake everything on the building of an independent infrastructure which will take us to independent sources of the raw materials for energy in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan .
freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time .
does the Commission also take the view that this consultation must by definition be mutual ?
unfortunately , most Members of this House are not aware that there is an opinion issued by Parliament &apos;s legal service which states that the current fisheries agreement with Morocco contravenes international law if it is not demonstrated that the people of Western Sahara benefit from the agreement .
I was pleased to hear that the European Commission was going to make a proposal in the spring to combat violence against women .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
under the current ETS , far from the polluter paying , we have seen many polluters making windfall profits thanks to the ETS .
the Environment DG has already launched several studies and is working on assessing the impacts of the key elements of the Convention .
forty per cent of the budget committed after the 2007 calls , under the &apos; Cooperation &apos; Specific Programmes , also support green technology R &amp; D.
most German automobile plants imposed compulsory Christmas holidays on the workforce as early as the start of December .
moreover , we have seen an unusually high number of deaths of migrant workers , including many compatriots of mine , many Portuguese citizens , even when legally employed .
I have tried to convey this in the table appended to the report .
in writing . - ( RO ) The EU enlargement has always been only a matter of time and of making political and economic systems compatible between the Member States .
we are also aware that two Catholic nuns have been kidnapped and are being held in Somalia .
on 3 March , the Turkish police arrested a number of journalists .
the EU and the Member States have a duty to create an energy policy that will ensure the sovereignty , political independence and economic security of every state .
I am pleased to see that Parliament stands united , once again , in this debate and that it has the will to forge a stronger and tighter partnership with Tajikistan .
one of my beliefs ( and I am not saying this just to appease the women here ! ) is that in human history , in the earliest periods , there was no concept of leaders .
all of which goes to show that the defenders of social Europe are not necessarily who we think they are .
this preliminary requirement leaves infrastructure operators no flexibility to take decisions on such measures in real time .
in writing . - I fully support my colleague &apos;s report , and would have done so in person had it been possible .
I am not sure what relation this has with the proclamation of independence of Kosovo , with which you seem to agree .
we are responsible to the citizens of the EU for ensuring that our fellow citizens , when ill , are comforted by the hope that the drugs needed to cure them are also developed in Europe .
it is both counter-productive and against the principles of good regulation to discriminate against all SWFs based on their origins .
citizens do not want less Europe .
that is for you to decide , but let it be clear that this would be the only appropriate signal to send out in the present circumstances .
I recommend that the measures proposed in the directive are adopted as quickly as possible .
this vote confirms a favourable change in how agriculture is taken into account in Community policies .
fourth : we will promote human rights and the rule of law in Russia , and
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , three years ago we modernised the industrial policy of the EU and established it as a cornerstone of our entire economic strategy .
( RO ) I would like to congratulate rapporteur Lucas and all her colleagues for their work on this report .
succession is already a Utopia , and association agreements are repeatedly infringed , as in the shameful case of tomatoes from Morocco , a situation that has been recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office with no decisive action by the Commission .
that is why I want once again to appeal to all the democratic forces in Europe , in this Parliament , in Greece , to unite in a consensus to do everything possible to ensure growth and prosperity in Europe .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this was an extremely interesting debate .
the report by Mrs Haug shows just how important is the role played by the Member States in the European Union &apos;s employment policy .
it is unfortunate that the plan is to establish this crisis management mechanism outside the EU institutions .
in the Commissioner &apos;s response , she also stressed the same thing about Article 19 .
there is my shot in the arm .
as the notions of true democracy and freedom come from the people , they cannot be forced from outside .
it also does not work for pelagic species , and we also now know that other factors influence the status of populations , such as errors in recruitment or environmental factors , which may result in incorrect definitions of maximum sustainable yield .
for the citizens of the country concerned , it is vital that these elections are conducted fairly and in a proper manner .
that arrangement de facto permits European businesses to be handicapped in relation to their competitors , particularly those from China .
even so , it can provide a conceptual and legal framework for state intervention in production , and the social and ecological conditions under which it takes place .
since our shared vision is to see a real European diplomatic service which is not just an extension of the diplomatic services of the 27 Member States , the Financial Regulation and Staff Regulations , which we will discuss today and vote on tomorrow , are of paramount importance .
please adopt a more fundamental policy on this issue .
this conscience has been burdened throughout the years with the conflicts provoked by Russia .
they just want the chain - where the product comes from and where it really originates from - to be fully traceable .
our best traditions connect with the values with which we identify the European cultural and political space .
a recent requirement now means that a note about religious identity also has to be included in passports .
this is what European consumers demand , just as they demand that their health be put before market interests .
also , football is always very interested in these subjects and it seems to drive the agenda .
I shall not mention them all but confine myself to one example .
4 .
the economic impact is immense and I am pleased that the Commissioner will be heading up a group to establish the economic consequences of this .
what Commissioner Tajani stated here is what we should be monitoring and what we need to do to ensure that these self-employed drivers can continue working after the hours they have spent driving .
the internal market operates well , on the whole . however , sometimes mistakes can be made too .
I can assure you that we expect to meet this deadline .
in addition , I propose leaving tried and tested instruments for market regulation untouched .
a popular initiative that is an example of participatory democracy - Mr Šefčovič has explained this very well - and of European democracy , because the issues that need to be covered by this initiative must be European issues , not local issues .
in recent weeks , we have seen the start of a difficult period throughout the world , in particular in relation to the financial crisis and its drastic effects on the world economy .
it is also becoming necessary to develop competitive clusters based on companies investing in research and the development of new technologies .
instead , the Bulgarian Government is conducting a policy which runs not only counter to national , but also to European policy on scientific research and education .
who actually wants these new initiatives ?
we have to find solutions so that a new financial crisis cannot happen again , but we also have to address the moral crisis that was at its root .
they wanted to protest against a decision which they considered to be another death sentence on their shipyard , and will put at least a thousand workers on the street .
a new political initiative , the &apos; Eastern Partnership &apos; has come about , whose mission is to reshape Europe &apos;s common neighbourhood policy and adapt it to the specific characteristics of this region , thereby making this process more active , more courageous and more ambitious .
we must draw a firm line between the resumption of talks and their further continuation .
the institutions and bodies concerned are the Commission , the Council , the Court of Justice , EPSO , OLAF and the European Aviation Safety Agency .
6 .
far too many in Parliament and among EU governments are trying to wriggle out of the promises given to Turkey as a candidate country .
only the local population itself can get Africa on its feet .
after the crisis of the presidential nomination , elections were held and democracy won .
we do not want to criminalise these people ; we want to educate them and get them on our side to tackle the real criminals in this process .
in the past , we discussed only security issues and now we even discuss climate change , energy , etc .
every dependence of one upon the other , inequality , and above all the lack of a sovereign state structure for the Arabs , will be constant sources of negative emotions , convictions and retaliation .
we voted against the proposal , because its objective is to further concentrate production in this sector .
it is possible that resources from the existing Progress programme will be used , a programme that was launched in 2007 and comprises actions concerning poverty reduction , anti-discrimination , social inclusion , gender and employment .
( SV ) Mr President , Prime Minister , we are discussing the future of Europe here , but the biggest question is who will decide that future .
Chile has been a source of protection and asylum for us in the past .
I am counting on you .
we therefore chose to abstain in the final vote .
we must make disabled women and girls more visible and , above all , we must ensure that they are given greater consideration at EU level .
I can only grant speaking time by &apos; catch the eye &apos; to Members who have not previously spoken during the debate , and I do not see anyone who has not spoken asking me for speaking time .
it is a disgraceful neglect by all of us of our duties in the single market .
the fact is that human practices have failed completely to treat our soil with respect and that efforts have been systematically made to engage in intensive production methods and in so doing to impoverish the soil and to adopt urban practices that have led to its degradation .
the rapporteur has also had to fight against misinformation and demagoguery .
the past few months have been a challenge .
such victories were only possible because we cooperated across political lines .
the examples in North Africa make us realise now that the EU &apos;s need for military preparedness and capability at the gates of Europe remains a fact .
it is about jobs in Europe and a better position for Europe in the world , and how should this be carried out if not by means of innovation ?
they have done the work ; they have made efforts .
furthermore , this FTA agenda and its drive to enforce intellectual property rights and data exclusivity endangers access to cheap generic medicines that are produced in India .
many ideas from my group have been worked into the report before us , and now we have a very good result .
this is one of the reasons why we are aiming in this direction .
the EIT is and should remain a European-driven initiative .
the other big question for my group was tariffs , mainly on the part of the British and Czechs .
I think it is important to have this from the beginning of the discussion of the European Union 2020 Strategy .
removing this programme will deprive Bulgaria &apos;s largest minority of the right to information in their mother tongue .
unemployment amongst young people - those under 25 - in Europe is 19.8 % , as you yourself said , and in Spain more than one in three of those under 25 are unemployed .
in writing . - To those of us from the new Member States , the omission of any legally binding commitment to geographic balance in the European External Action Service is a disappointment .
I voted in favour of the draft Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1338 / 2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting because it is a realistic and effective proposal for combating counterfeiting of the euro .
it is true that this principle of subsidiarity does not apply to the implementation of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights , the international court in charge of enforcing the European Convention on Human Rights .
the European Parliament will have more duties and more responsibilities to Europe &apos;s citizens .
those are the main issues .
the objective is to have the proposal agreed at the November Council .
the stress tests should be evaluated on technical grounds and not on political grounds or grounds which leave room for speculation ;
otherwise , nothing will be credible in terms of human rights .
this support has been manifested in various ways , including the appointment of the first EU Special Representative for the region as far back as 1994 .
what has happened in Berlin recently , where the suburban rapid rail system has gone to pieces as a result of profits being prioritised , must remain an absolutely exceptional case .
it is not for me to analyse every amendment separately here because there is certainly not enough time .
the Treaty of Lisbon creates a more understandable , democratic and efficient European Union and we cannot quit on that just yet .
further emigration from this region , which , prior to the crisis , was experiencing a slight upturn , is to be feared .
organisations do very valuable work .
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Reding and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed during this five-year term .
the report suggests a number of possibilities that could be explored further , including the provision of health services .
education and training issues are clearly of the greatest significance , given the never-ending advances of science and technology , and the increasing incorporation of scientific and technical knowledge into productive processes .
energy and climate change ( introduction )
well-thought-out programmes are what is needed .
we will continue to refine the clear and methodologically sound approach we have advanced .
similarly , the report recognises the legitimate interest of the EU to play a role on the new stage and stresses the imperative to take advantage of the opportunities that arise through supporting sustainable development in the area by its inhabitants , particularly the indigenous communities .
as has been said here today , the euro is an undeniable success .
lastly , if the Member States are too timid or too frightened to deal with this , let me make another suggestion that perhaps is a little contentious here .
citizens must be able to move freely and to make full use of their rights in this area without internal borders .
in particular I welcome the responsible Commissioner , Benita Ferrero-Waldner .
in conclusion , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the workers of the European Parliament for their cooperation and the honourable Members of this House for their patience .
in order to address the future needs of companies and consumers and to yield all its potential benefits in favour of public and social objectives , European standardisation must adapt to the challenges posed by globalisation , climate change , the emergence of new economic powers and technological evolution .
in any case , if Commissioner McCreevy wants to advocate transparency in financial markets , I think he ought to start by being transparent about his own diary !
it is clear , as other speakers have already said , that prevention is of absolutely fundamental significance here . for prevention is always significantly cheaper than treatment .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation .
more to the point , I abstained because they do not Europeanise economic policies and the economic risk .
I admit that these results obviously cannot obscure the urgent need to encourage the Tunisian authorities to make further advances in human rights and governance ; we are well aware that there is still work to be done .
I also want to thank him for his very strong engagement with the work of this committee in Parliament - it has been very much appreciated .
however , we must not forget that Member States have voiced their opposition to such a directive because it does not come under the EU &apos;s jurisdiction .
my colleagues and I believe that our first priority is to evaluate what this proposal will do for consumers and business in real practical terms .
moreover , there is a similar threat in Slovakia from the reopening of several old mines for precious metals , where the use of cyanide technology is under consideration due to the low concentrations of the precious metals .
firstly , it is generally known that Slovakia has fully met the Maastricht macro-economic criteria , which is proof of Slovakia &apos;s formal readiness to adopt the euro .
the European Union is one of the most open markets , while eminent partners of ours maintain high trade barriers .
I also agree fully with Mr Swoboda , who is no longer here , not because of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy , but because he is right , namely in that it is decided at local level whether or not something will succeed .
Mr Tannock , caning in Malaysia was not introduced by Sharia law , but is a carryover from British colonial times .
I voted in favour of this document because Mauritania is one of the poorest countries in Africa , classified as a Heavily Indebted Poor Country , and financially dependent on foreign aid , and has been characterised by considerable political instability .
the debate is closed .
consequently , although the report includes some positive proposals for reinforcing cooperation , its initial basis is unacceptable .
this is why the success of the alliance and , by implication , of a democratic Moldova , depends hugely on the support of its European partners .
the bottom line is that we have a compromise with which we can live and which we ought to adopt .
they know what visa liberalisation means , they know that , by abolishing their visas in the European Union , we will not be giving away jobs or rights to asylum or citizenship or suchlike .
the cooperation was extremely constructive and I would also like to express my sincere thanks for that .
incidentally , that is why I speak in English - so that people can understand me without the need for interpretation .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the report &apos; 2009 discharge : performance , financial management and control of EU agencies &apos; in order to acknowledge that the functioning of all EU agencies needs to be further improved .
but the Greek Government is stuck inside the euro straitjacket .
the second point that I would like to make is that the contribution of the new Member States to humanitarian aid tends to be rather modest .
consequently , what do we see ?
the Commissioner touched upon this earlier , and Mrs Pack devoted much attention to this aspect in her fine report .
its consequences are comparable with those of fascism and Nazism .
the next item is the report by Chris Davies , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles .
we were in constant contact with Prague and other capitals .
in this connection , we wish to highlight the need for democratic control of expenditure relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
quantified indicators for education and social inclusion will have to be set at the June European Council .
I would now like to come to my final and decisive point .
we cannot tolerate this .
there can be no doubt that setting up this quasi-European state , on the principles laid down in the Treaty , will significantly restrict genuine democracy , which will effectively become a democracy in name only .
it observes that the share of agriculture in the food supply chain decreased , while the share of the wholesale and distribution sectors increased .
Over-dramatisation of these divergences allows the constraining patterns of the past to re-emerge , makes the present uncertain and hinders constructive progress .
some of these will be decided when it comes to their implementation .
Mr President , as far as the Treaty is concerned , the devil is not in the detail , he is in the ratification .
I believe that the European Union must pursue a sensible and realistic policy towards Russia .
please do not return to this , because it distracts us from future developments .
instead of asking for all barriers restricting market access to be immediately removed in full , it asks for them to be reduced gradually or , where necessary , for them to be dismantled .
it is well known that repressive laws restricting citizens in the exercise of their civil and political rights have always been in force in those countries .
the response must involve legal migration , as an alternative to illegal immigration .
this type of practice has been the subject of complaints made to the European Parliament by businesses .
in writing . - Car manufacturing within the EU depends upon reaching standards which can facilitate stronger environmental rules .
furthermore , it consolidates the difference between minor discharges and major infringements and the corresponding penalties these deserve .
the Member States and the Commission must act decisively in response to this situation .
subject : multilingualism in the EU institutions
however , it was important for the compromise not to take the form of solutions that merely aimed at prohibiting any reference to ratings in any context whatsoever , where the latter had not been established in the framework of this regulation .
Parliament will follow you .
so why do we not create a flexible budget ?
the limits of the intergenerational contract have been reached .
they are not interested in freedom of information in Europe , but only in Italy ...
Union citizens are treated differently depending on which country &apos;s territory they find themselves on .
the vote will take place on Tuesday , 9 February 2010 .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations , based on the own-initiative report by my excellent colleague Piia-Noora Kauppi in response to a communication from the European Commission on the same subject .
the vote concerns , among other things , two payments of almost EUR 24 million in total to the car industry in Sweden and Austria .
as for the environment , we have certainly done it a huge favour over the past couple of days .
one example is Amendment 54 .
this is , therefore , a profound change ...
in other words , the European Union is not the one who should be forcing its own solutions to problems of this kind - on the contrary .
the Lega Nord , the party I represent , voted for the Treaty in the Italian Parliament and I personally was the rapporteur .
this includes efforts to strengthen the independence of the judiciary , to open up the economy and to ensure fair and transparent competition - for example , by the adoption of a public procurement law in line with international standards and the European Union acquis .
I welcome the compromise that was reached .
however , the starting up of visa liberalisation negotiations with Kosovo , as requested in the report , presupposes the recognition of the creation of the state of Kosovo .
this is not the first time that Israeli armed forces have committed crimes against humanity .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to give you some short explanations concerning your remarks .
we must tell Mr Mubarak to calm down , and the best way to calm things down is for him to clear off , to get out .
( ES ) In that context it should be noted that the European Parliament is the only international organisation which has a website and web television in 23 different languages .
once we have information of a high quality , we will be able to inform and educate consumers without giving rise to distrust or concern in relation to sensitive product lines such as pharmaceutical products or foodstuffs .
Mr Lundgren , I am now cutting you off .
energy conservation therefore makes it even easier for us to raise our climate target a little .
I share with you the opinion that these regional fisheries organisations are very important for our policy and we need to boost their activity in order to tackle illegal fisheries worldwide .
in Slavonic languages , &apos; Ukraine &apos; means &apos; border country &apos; . for the Russians , it was always a remote province , and now Ukraine is a border country for the European Union as well , as a result of the last but one enlargement .
this acceptance will enable the EC to continue to play a leading role in the WTO on the issue of access to medicines .
this is not simply a face-saving compromise in relation to the version submitted .
agenda for next sitting : see Minutes
I therefore believe that we are making a new start because , in the midst of the crisis , the European Parliament is setting a good example by keeping its expenditure for 2010 at very realistic , I would even say low levels .
we know this from Chernobyl , yet not only because of Chernobyl .
however , the current state of affairs proves that we must continue to make structural adjustments and that we really need to move towards economic governance .
until now , the principle of reciprocity has been applied through bilateral visa waiver agreements concluded between Brazil and Member States on an individual basis .
( PL ) Madam President , the Tibetan language is part of the long history of a nation which has fought for years to preserve its own culture , and it is an element that closely binds the community together .
we want a strong EIT and we do not just want a pilot project either because that would deter many investors , and we need investors .
and , of course , the President of the European Commission , Mr Barroso , is a former Maoist .
placing of plant protection products on the market (
Fausto Correia was and remains famous and well-loved in Portugal for his unremitting , life-long mission to establish democracy and his dedication to the core values of fraternity and neighbourliness .
the main information must be clear to the consumer at first sight .
healthy eating is part of general education .
for this reason , I cannot support the reports put forward .
the problem was not resolved , however , and following a conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council , the Commission was invited to weigh up the pros and cons of extending working time rules to self-employed workers and thus present a proposal in 2008 .
the costs and bureaucracy associated with the misguided policy of multilingualism will only increase as the EU expands further .
we would like to see the Commission becoming more proactive in solving this unacceptable state of affairs .
a long-stay visa will thus have the same effect as a residence permit as regards circulation in the Schengen area .
we did leave our mark on the freedom agenda , but also on the social agenda .
the agreements on visa waivers and air services confirm the good relations between Brazil and the European Union .
general road policy is based on the European Union &apos;s general road legislation and on general standards , but not necessarily using the same benchmarks .
I voted against a favourable conclusion to the visa liberalisation process for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
in 2008 , this House adopted a report on wage inequality thanks to the excellent work of Mrs Bauer .
North Africa , revolving mirrors , solar cells , continuous-current transmission and meeting 15 % of energy requirements .
we must take action , not merely indulge in rhetoric .
your contributions improve the text ; for example , the new deadline set for designing a national approach , an explicit reference to the involvement of local and regional authorities .
we must seize this historic opportunity to reverse the climate change trend .
I firmly believe that this tool will bring greater efficiency and financial savings in this area in the next two years , reducing dependency on external services .
for this reason , it is absolutely essential to work on security and its many interrelationships , such as how changes of government should be monitored ; those governments should be urged to make a proactive commitment to improve human rights .
I agree with the rapporteur that financial compensation needs to be paid to fishermen during the closed season and I also welcome the proposed plan to reactivate traps .
the next item is the four draft resolutions on Laos and Vietnam .
because , besides its military arsenal , it succeeds in exporting its culture and its ideas and in making them attractive .
the remaining Member States should follow their example and be more transparent on this issue .
yet what is remarkable today is the great disparities between the Member States with regard to the implementation of our waste requirements .
- ( RO ) Fellow Members , excise duty and electronic charging systems in general appear to be technical matters , but they also serve certain powerful political objectives .
this is not a dignified role for our parliament .
I agree with the main political message of the preliminary report , which maintains that the EU budget has a crucial role to play in helping the Member States recover from the economic and social crisis , in the sense of promoting growth and jobs .
when we met with you and with Mr Daul , we said at the beginning that it was not going to be easy , because there is the prospect of the European elections and that inevitably puts a strain on things .
we need broader support from the citizens .
it would not have been appropriate for this disguised personal attack to have been supported by Parliament .
Parliament will endeavour to shape the budget in such a way that its message will be clearer to the EU &apos;s citizens .
the sanctions that the resolution demands must definitely be implemented against the political leadership .
we are talking about sharks , tuna , polar bears , big cats and elephants .
I voted in favour of Parliament &apos;s resolution on Turkey &apos;s 2010 progress report .
our Mediterranean partners are creating a network of free trade agreements among themselves , and the Agadir Agreement , in force since 2007 , is also open to other Mediterranean countries .
( applause )
I challenge you , President-in-Office of the Council , to explain this agreement to a citizen who is still interested in what we do in the European Parliament .
in fact , this has been the topic of a very heated discussion in our Russia Delegation , in connection with the Moscow visit we have planned for the end of this week .
up to now , we the new Member States have been transit countries , but now we will also be destination countries and our responsibility will increase , as we too need fresh supplies of labour .
( SK ) The Black Sea region , an area of production and transit , has a strategic significance for the diversification and security of energy supplies to the European Union .
if the hardest hit by cuts in the structural funds are those who really need support , then the policy is unacceptable .
I agree with all those Members who have asked the banks to do more .
I want to emphasise the importance of improving the security of our energy resources .
the European Parliament , as the champion of human rights , spoke out immediately .
for this reason , I join my colleagues from the Popolo della Libertà delegation in wholeheartedly supporting the rejection of the European Commission proposal .
we must ensure a quick transition to stability in North Africa .
on top of this , there was also a little arrogance in claiming a leading role in the process of the fight against climate change .
on many accounts , the Commission is already in line with the calls of Parliament and is working on a number of outstanding issues identified in the report .
all too often this has led to unacceptable abuses in relation to working conditions , and to human rights violations and environmental damage .
Europe and Russia need each other .
this also has nothing to do with the European Rail Traffic Management System ( ERTMS ) .
we cannot bring ourselves to see the logic : that jamming together countries with widely divergent conditions and needs into a single currency was bound to cause precisely the strains that some of us were predicting 10 years ago when the project was launched .
I hope that the work we have done together will be regarded as making a competent contribution to making VET efficient , transparent and mobile .
it is an important contribution to the policy on Members &apos; finances , transparency and public relations .
these , then , are the comments I wanted to make on this report , and I thank the rapporteur once again .

hundreds of people were held after the presidential elections because they took part in the post-election demonstrations and made critical comments .
many least developed countries have made progress in their development , but progress has been uneven and considerable work remains to be done .
I am convinced that we must do this as soon as we possibly can .
another litmus test of the country &apos;s ability to deliver on EU integration is the census .
as part of the fight against poverty , we should finance programmes such as the free distribution of food among the poorest .
the developments in Tirana on Friday , 21 January 2011 , were tragic .
the Commission presented a balanced proposal .
if we are going to continue to come to Strasbourg , perhaps we could make some changes to the transport systems to enable us to come here ?
a fact , and you can see it for yourselves .
the joint declaration on building policy emphasises the importance of a medium- to long-term approach to building .
why have we had to lend them money ?
however , the most efficient potential for enhancing integration capacity is still not fully used .
I have also been told that , in Bangladesh , it is not the national legislation that is the problem but the enforcement of such legislation .
the President of the European Parliament , Mr Pöttering , was in the chair when Mr Schulz spoke , and so this is a question for Mr Pöttering .
in all honesty , we must admit that the situation would be just the same in Europe .
those Member States have been applying the Schengen rules on external border checks since their accession , and since September 2007 they also carry out checks on persons in the Schengen Information System - SIS .
Barcelona was a very good idea , but there was one problem at the Barcelona Summit .
Mr President , even though Switzerland has not yet decided to become a Member State of the European Union , it has long shown a serious interest in broad cooperation with the EU in the area of education and professional training for young people .
I believe that this allows Romania to demonstrate its ability to act as a strategic partner of the United States in the Black Sea region and become a net European supplier of security .
time is pressing and our prompt action and response could make the difference between an accident and a human tragedy with incalculable consequences for the future development of these populations .
this has proven highly problematic since .
I also anticipate a similar commitment to finding timely common solutions on the part of the Commission .
although I do not agree with some details in the report , such as the inclusion of biocides , these do not detract from the Commission &apos;s basic ideas .
how do we get a reliable list of safe countries of origin ?
- ( PL ) Madam President , it will take a good while yet until the politicians understand that it is not the burning of coal , but solar activity , which causes the phenomenon of climate change .
nor must it be abused for fishing expeditions for questioning , rather than the proper focus on return for charge and prosecution .
is it expedient to close coal-fired power plants , one of the cheapest sources of electricity , when the alarming signs of energy shortage are beginning to be noticeable around the world ?
under the present circumstances , our prime target must be small , efficient enterprises .
we need to work on this and hence we are demanding that there should also be additional safety labelling , particularly for toys , so that safety can also be guaranteed .
what I would like to do is put the three that first came to my attention together , so that would be Ms McGuinness , Mr Mitchell , who asked the original question , and Ms Budreikaitė .
the main aim of the proposed Regulation is to limit the global supply of mercury by banning exports of metallic mercury from the EU and putting it into safe storage .
the post-Christmas sales provide an excellent opportunity for checking .
Europe is the world &apos;s biggest export power .
as Chair of the EU-Central Asia delegation , I hope , even despite the recent ethnic clashes , that we will do everything we can to bring about national peace and the lasting return of democratic life in Kyrgyzstan .
I will witness the elections in Switzerland as an observer .
in writing . - ( LV ) A new financial transaction tax will not solve European Union Member States &apos; budgetary problems .
this creates complicated and unnecessary situations for individuals and border guards who have to attempt to discover whether visas have been falsified , whether a reference on the SIS system is incorrect and should be removed , or whether the visas should never have been granted .
the European economy , and European industry in particular , will be successful if it forges ahead resolutely with the transition to a knowledge-based economy .
therefore , the EU keeps repeating our key message that the parties to the conflict make substantial efforts in conducting independent and credible investigations into the alleged violations .
above all , I wished to reaffirm my commitment to combating the construction of a fortress , security-driven and ineffective Europe to ensure the safety of our fellow citizens , via the Europol and Eurojust budgets .
as we prepare for the launch of the next three-year cycle , we must update the strategy in the light of lessons learnt and new circumstances .
then it would not be possible for health care , education or development of infrastructure to take place in these countries .
having examined the capacity of this pipeline , we have established that , in order for it to be viable and efficient , it needs 31 billion cubic metres of gas a year .
transparency is therefore urgently required .
therefore , the ECR have voted to decrease many areas of EU spending .
the chances are that there will also be those who will give credit to President Mubarak for the positive role he has played in maintaining some degree of stability in the Middle East .
that is why I am delighted that the Council arrived at a common position in October , so that we here in Parliament can , as we always hoped , progress quickly with our consultations .
however , it makes no difference whether a self-employed person who is tired after doing paperwork or an employee or driver who is tired for one of any number of other reasons is in charge of the vehicle .
the only way to tackle that is to have a genuine bond market in Europe of EUR 4 000 billion or 5 000 billion which can be compared to what exists in other parts of the world , with special treatment for the triple-A countries .
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and say a true thank you because now , European legislation , the European rules on maritime safety , are certainly better than they used to be .
what sources are we going to use to produce such a list ?
Mr President , I am extremely concerned that the Commission is adamant in continuing trade talks based on a mandate from 1999 , which will undoubtedly have a negative impact on agriculture across the EU .
we Germans in particular should not think that we always know better .
( FR ) Madam President , I am happy to find my friend Michel Barnier in this Chamber .
rule of law in Russia ( debate )
I also think it is wrong to purchase a Russian veto in the Security Council with generous sell-offs of key companies to Russian firms .
I think some of the comments made today unfortunately by Mr Farage were over the top , but at this stage I am becoming aware of the fact that Mr Farage is like a long-playing record .
we are opposed to the steps constantly being made in this direction , because they are steps which strengthen the facility for the European Union to promote neo-liberal policies at the expense of the workers .
no single citizen should ever suffer from persecution because of his or her race , religion , gender , social situation , language , nationality or sexual orientation .
an Arab Tiananmen .
I think she has a very exciting , but also very difficult task in negotiating this budget , and that is because the framework is tight .
we must make an unambiguous commitment .
more and more companies are relocating , taking advantage of the lower labour costs in a number of countries , particularly China and India , with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
we do not want this kind of treaty ; we want a treaty of disarmament rather than armament .
Parliament &apos;s report calls on the Commission to perform impact assessments and to monitor this measure .
the Swedish parties should therefore be prepared to review their passive attitude to the euro as a currency for Sweden .
this will result in transparency for citizens .
Mr President , the number of natural recipients of EU funding is currently just under half the total membership .
that is what I demand of the Member States in this context .
Iran is a large nation and a great culture that has more similarities with us than we can imagine .
the Parliament , like the European Council up to now , refused to take the hard decisions .
however , the benefits that it could bring for the development of Africa and for fully including Africa in globalisation , which to a certain extent it is excluded from - I say that in inverted commas - are going to be incredibly important .
notwithstanding Directive 2002 / 73 / EC on equal treatment between men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training , promotion and working conditions , further efforts still need to be made to achieve proper transposition .
this does not augur well for a new Doha Round .
let us either create a transparent chapter for wine within agricultural legislation or reject the report .
however , I would , at the same time , like to state at this point that I see one systemic problem in the activities of the office of the Ombudsman .
I agree that it is advisable to heighten the efficiency of the procedure by making committee decisions clearer and more accessible .
furthermore , that is true in both rural and urban areas .
written statements ( Rule 142 )
next , I also need in turn to reply to those who are concerned by the risks of a brain drain .
however , I want to continue to mention , Mrs Ashton , the need to expect a much more coherent strategy from you on security policy .
dyes are after all hardly essential and irreplaceable additives .
it represents the boundary of European civilisation in the face of an onslaught of illegal immigration which is deliberate , very often entails highly distressing humanitarian tragedies and represents big business for Mafia-type criminal organisations .
the white goods manufacturers of inefficient goods have actually seen their products fall off the market .
I recently visited a printing company in my constituency of London , where I found out more about ink-jet printing .
secondly , as I mentioned , we need to change our communication strategy ; and thirdly , we need to improve the quality of the data that we have .
no other person in a so-called democracy has the power to initiate , legislate and execute the same legislation and not be elected individually by anybody .
ladies and Gentlemen !
Hungarian is not an official language in Romania , but for the Hungarian community of one and a half million living in that country , it represents the language in which they learn about events that are happening in the world around them .
firstly , I think I am right in saying that Mr Jouyet previously regretted in the press the influence of US conservative sectors , or certain conservative sectors , in the &apos; No &apos; vote in the Irish referendum .
I certainly will take on board what Mr Purvis said about looking at what the incidence of short selling contributed to the demise of some of these institutions as against what long-term disposals by long-term investors have contributed to it .
correction is going to be very painful , especially in the United States , but Europe is not immune to economic downturn .
author . - Mr President , three years ago , a major reform of European cohesion policy was introduced taking into account the unprecedented enlargement of the Union and new emerging challenges .
it seems to me that one of our fundamental concerns should be that differences between the European Union and its neighbours in terms of economic well-being and political freedom must not be so great that we will be faced with a great wave of illegal immigration or political refugees .
on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , I would say to them that they have completed this task most excellently .
this is why so many of them are also so well prepared .
is that not the height of hypocrisy ?
on the basis of these arguments , we have voted in favour of the proposal of the European Parliament , but against the legislative resolution in the final vote .
we regret the failure to adopt the proposal by our parliamentary group calling upon all countries to immediately halt the production of landmines and urging that under no circumstances or conditions should EU troops make use of mines .
let us help the Commission and Croatia along this path .
I would emphasise that what is needed is complete funding by the European Union for the food aid programme ; thus I am in favour of the adoption of the draft legislative resolution .
we have underlined this position with this report .
Madam President , today we in the EPP say to the people of Bosnia , of Albania and of Serbia : you are not forgotten ; we have not abandoned you .
without widespread public support the European Union will lack popular legitimacy for what it is doing .
I remember the debate in this House with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who was acting as though he had the solution ahead of the G20 Summit in London .
it is vital that we all remember that the users of transport are the most important stakeholders - a fact often forgotten by some transport companies .
it is therefore only natural that people are disenchanted with the slow pace of change .
the environmental economic accounts we are calling for today are not perfect .
this compromise document , this compromise text , has been long in the making .
how , indeed , is it possible to have a dialogue with a country that does not respect the rights of the child and extends the death penalty to minors ?
finally , as regards the import of American poultry treated with chlorinated water , the wording in the text is too ambiguous .
the success of the recovery also depends a lot on the success of the EU 2020 strategy .
finally , Mr Skinner and Mr Kelly talked about the companies that sometimes suffer as a result of these punishments and the social problems that that can cause .
the annexes broadly reflect the content of the Community &apos;s Implementing Rules on airworthiness ( Commission Regulation No 1702 / 2003 ) and maintenance ( Commission Regulation No 2042 / 2003 ) to be modified by the parties based on a decision of the Bilateral Oversight Board .
a few weeks later , we had the great pleasure of welcoming here in our gallery the leaders of the democratic political parties from that country , embarked on a new path .
I can only agree with the desire expressed by Mr Leinen today when he said that , by the end of this decade , we should have moved away from gross domestic product and towards a green domestic product .
as it reflects , services account for the largest share of GDP in developed countries .
together , we have achieved a great agreement and I am happy to commend it to you .
the Commission shares the opinion of Parliament that the detention of 158 people held in Nongkhai requires urgent solution .
I welcome the European Parliament &apos;s decision to request Member States to make a firm commitment to combating child sex abuse , especially bearing in mind how vulnerable children using chat rooms and online forums are to abuse .
that is actually already in the Treaty .
( GA ) Mr President , I would like to lend my support to those condemning the attacks and to show my solidarity with the people of Gaza .
I therefore look forward to further collaboration with Parliament , the European Council and the social partners on the preparations aimed at improving this Directive .
in the Youth in Action Programme , the European Union has launched the European Voluntary Service .
in Parliament we have presented a broad front to the way the Commission has approached the alternatives under consideration .
these include the search for peace and security in the region , the social and geopolitical impact of the economic crisis , environmental concerns , the management of migratory flows , and the role of women in our respective societies .
in writing . - The EU took an important step with its political decision .
this principle is enshrined in the well-known document I have here - Magna Carta of 1215 - which has guaranteed this right in my country for 800 years .
therefore , I fully agree with the rapporteur that the &apos; present report constitutes a further step of a continuous effort .
therefore , when it comes to defining research as financial investment in knowledge , innovation would be the reverse process .
my group &apos;s amendments to this report are intended to focus , or rather re-focus , the report on these principles .
I very much welcome the report &apos;s focus on systemic and general issues rather than on individual cases , for which , as you know , OLAF is independent in its investigations .
the budget line number of the Pilot Project on an all-inclusive cooperation between public authorities , commercial firms and not-for-profit enterprises on integrating people into society and employment should be changed to another line , 04 03 12 , for technical reasons .
as for gender equality in business , attention should be drawn to the fact that only 3 % of companies are chaired by women , because they face discrimination and obstacles preventing them from climbing the career ladder and pursuing leadership .
thus far , however , this has not been made into a motion for a resolution and that , it strikes me , is something lacking .
it recommended that the data be verified and that a system of exchange of best practice be established .
in order for Russia to be more closely involved in joint projects within the framework of NATO , I would expect Russia to mainstream democracy , human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law .
the TRAN Committee has proposed the requirement to install the ERTMS gradually in the trans-European transport network ( TEN-T ) and the conditioning of providing European funds by the mandatory use of ERTMS .
Mr President , the outcome of the Council meeting in Brussels last week and the conclusions of the UN Climate Change Conference in Poznań have been positively welcomed by many MEPs in the European Parliament .
it is the Council and the Commission statements on Kosovo .
I refer , in particular , to Europeana , which we must strengthen and promote further .
the non-participation of the aviation sector in this system could cause important compensatory costs in the long term .
this is always an effective trick here in the House , and also together with the Commission : if you cannot get a solution with the Council , then you simply call it a question of subsidiarity .
and now that draft proposal is in your hands and in the hands of the European Council .
this represents a difficult task for us all , as it means that we cannot betray this confidence and that we must give the people &apos;s voice more influence in European decision making .
I wish to conclude with a question that Mr Wiersma also raised .
we have added two more areas to it : one is sustainable consumption , and the other is services of general interest , so we are expanding .
not only does an increase in food prices threaten the lowest income groups , but it also reveals much deeper and more serious problems that will pose a major threat in the future .
the question of jobs is a completely different issue .
we must not give up , however .
statements by the President
4 .
it is not about abandoning citizens &apos; rights of free movement .
another priority is a people &apos;s Europe .
however , if he believes he has been misreported , he should come to this House and tell us how and why .
in the resolution the Council called on the Member States and the Commission to ensure , in accordance with their respective powers , that persons with disabilities were able to access all of their human rights .
this is a policy with very clear added value for the whole of the EU .
I hold Sweden &apos;s involvement in the strategic discussions on the Baltic Sea region in high regard .
there are many challenges in these turbulent times : a severe economic recession , the uncertainty as regards the Treaty of Lisbon and the negotiations ahead of the climate conference in Copenhagen .
nevertheless , bringing the 41 Romanian zoological parks up to European standards within the established deadline , namely by the end of this year , seems to be almost impossible to achieve .
another major benefit will result from the reduction of the overall costs to the European economy of moving capital around the region , which is estimated today at two to three per cent of the total gross domestic product .
the European Union has always been concerned with the free movement of people and goods .
I also believe that we need to continue to work with like-minded energy partners , such as Norway , Canada and Australia , to strengthen the consensus on the value of open , transparent and competitive international energy markets .
Mr President , I have already condemned the repressive measures taken by the authorities in Minsk and I have called for the immediate release of all those detained on political grounds , as well as the reopening of the OSCE office in Minsk .
where can we make the biggest savings ?
models once held up such as the much lauded working-time accounts , which are used up in a matter of weeks , demonstrate the limits of flexible working hours .
these are questions that we did not ask today , at a point at which one-third of the period defined as being quick-start has already passed .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the report , and first of all I would like to congratulate Estonia on the decision by the European Parliament to allow its entry into the euro area on 1 January 2011 .
but he and the other prophets of doom were wrong .
the Commission would like to see complete harmonisation on the basis of a uniform standard and a binding undertaking from the industry to do this .
I believe that this is a good thing , because in this way , the Commissioner can listen to Parliament &apos;s budgetary priorities before drawing up the draft budget .
although we have made progress in this area , more needs to be done .
I see the agreement on further financing and its implementation as a sign of the European Union &apos;s solidarity with Bulgaria and as an important contribution to nuclear safety in Europe and beyond .
I believe that there is an appropriation effect and another , far greater effect , to do with respect , and that gives the Member States powers .
recently , Commissioner , and you are in a position to know this , in this Parliament it opposed &apos; CARS 21 &apos; in order not to reduce emissions below 130 grams .
in reality , it is not the severity of the punishment which determines its importance in prevention , but its inevitability .
I support Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert &apos;s report on the next steps in border management in the European Union .
at the same time , I would like to point out that many women consciously and freely choose to work in the home on behalf of the family .
written statements ( Rule 149 )
Commissioner , I trust in what I know to be your total determination and vigilance to ensure that this does not lead to a distortion of competition for the French banks , the European banks , and for those who finance the economy in general .
only 10-20 % of cereals change hands on the global market , and yet a reduction in production can result in a state of panic .
the world economy is in trouble and the cure will be very long-term .
sovereignty does not entitle you to throttle your own people .
however various amendments have unfortunately changed it in the wrong way .
she sets a very good example .
from this point of view , central and eastern European Member States are lagging far behind : schools , the school environment , transport facilities , even the hospitals , other institutions , public institutions , for example , are all inaccessible to wheelchair users .
unfortunately , the present model for effort-sharing proposed by the Council would mean that the European Union would reduce emissions mainly outside the EU through CDM / JI .
I believe this will happen .
indeed , the speeches at times revealed very different points of view .
we have to keep in mind that the most important thing we can give to SMEs is a real internal market .
I must stress the need for the EU to respond to demographic challenges .
it is all very well to have products that are labelled according to their area of farming or according status as a traditional speciality , but unless the consumer is aware of its meaning , it is , in fact , like reading an alien language .
the ensuing benefits will greatly exceed the financial cost .
in addition , Article 159 of the EC Treaty provides that the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament , the Council , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions every three years on progress made towards achieving economic and social cohesion .
( EL ) Mr President , the next few days will mark :
I find myself in an awkward situation , as Commissioner in charge of humanitarian aid and disaster response , when I can help the victims of the floods in Pakistan quickly , but there is nothing in my hands as an instrument to help the victims of this disaster .
I therefore voted in favour .
implementation of Goldstone recommendations on Israel / Palestine (
in order to promote stability among its eastern neighbours and minimise the impact on Member States , the EU must adopt a tough policy towards Russia , which should be drafted in close cooperation with transatlantic partners and include the relevant multilateral organisations , as well as the OSCE .
I recall that both President Sarkozy and I went to Camp David to propose to President Bush a global response .
this gender-specific violence , which also has a strong negative impact on children , and tends to worsen during periods of economic and social crisis , can no longer be accepted .
I &apos;m out of here - keep the shoes , but you &apos;re on your own from now on . &apos;
at the same time , I hope that Italy will finally be in position to adopt long-term strategic measures in line with European legislation , for the good of the people , first and foremost , but also for the country &apos;s reputation throughout the world .
bilateral or interregional negotiations on ambitious free-trade agreements are becoming a necessary addition to the multilateral framework , especially since the failure of the negotiations in July .
why did you not say thank you ?
we attach great importance to the joint action to be undertaken up until the middle of 2009 and in the second half of 2009 .
however , as far as Parliament is concerned , like the Commissioner , I too hope that our message is very clear .
documents received : see Minutes
that is not correct .
in the European Union , we are experiencing , not 27 economic crises , but one single one , a very serious and deep crisis .
this issue has been identified as a policy priority by both the European Parliament and the Council in the context of the overall effort to protect and foster innovation of European creators and consequently the competitiveness of the European economy .
I would like to thank you for that .
what the President said can surely be incorporated into a resolution that Parliament could adopt as early as this Thursday .
I am curious to know how the European elite will behave ; will they show solidarity with Member States where the crisis has grown to a huge scale , or will they only look after their own interests ?
we need an information campaign aimed at parents and teachers .
once again I want to underline the importance of convergent , horizontal work .
the vote will take place during today &apos;s vote .
the countries with the greatest responsibility in this matter did not reach a consensus on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank all my fellow Members for the really excellent work they have done .
over 4 200 Palestinians have been injured , according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .
can I just say that I was delighted that Madam Hautala , the Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights , wrote to me to say that she was pleased with the design of how we plan to deal with human rights within the new organisation .
the New European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights also provides a wide scope for activities in the field of gender equality .
it is not the euro which is at stake ; it is financial instability driven by bad behaviour of fiscal policies , of course , with the interaction with markets which is always there , as we are in market economies .
thirdly , colleagues , if you say that the European Parliament is not competent to talk about these matters , I wonder why we are competent to discuss matters like the shape of cucumbers but not the fundamental rights of our citizens .
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
we need strict authorisation rules for the companies and we need a liability obligation and the separation of the commodity flows .
like many Members , I welcome the signature in December 2007 of a new Administrative Cooperation Agreement between the EESC and the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) for the period 2008 to 2014 , aware that such cooperation will be financially advantageous for the European taxpayer .
the implementation of the European Union strategy for marine and maritime research under the current financial perspective will ensure the promotion in the coming years of marine and maritime research at Community level , through the framework programme instruments .
indeed , investment in environmental technologies in management should lead recovery efforts .
I , too , am delighted to be back here with you , as I am every month .
and let them not forget that it is their responsibility , first and foremost , to provide for the wellbeing of citizens and not to deny them a European future , because it is crystal clear that the political crisis hampers any and all progress .
in short , just go for the compulsory solidarity mechanism that we have been arguing for all this time .
we also need to look at the wider benefits , for the European economy as a whole , that are potentially deliverable by the opening up of trade .
there is a group of Commissioners working on this Pensions White Paper , and with Vice-President Reding participating and contributing , we will manage to address the gender dimension of pensions more forcefully than in the previous Green Paper .
at the same time , although the infant mortality rate has fallen at Community level to 4.7 in a thousand inhabitants , there are still some Member States where this figure is 12 in a thousand inhabitants .
we therefore need targeted employment policies that allow the impact of the crisis on women to be assessed and counter-cyclical solutions to be considered .
it should be highlighted that fur is often used as trimming in relatively inexpensive garments , which are often imported from Asia .
the next item is the report by Mr Corbett , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on amendment of Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure in light of the proposals by the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform concerning the work of the Plenary and initiative reports .
in this connection , I wanted to take the floor to thank the Swedish Presidency and , in particular , the Czech Presidency , as they could have totally ruined the second reading : they could have refused to go to conciliation .
of course , we are supporting the resolution in Geneva for a special rapporteur on Iran .
this terrible disease , which destroys the lives of millions of families worldwide , is preventable .
the concerns expressed by the rapporteur himself are enough to prove the weakness of the agreement , justifying our abstention .
they then agreed an advice note , which has no standing at all in the Treaties , but that gave our rapporteur , Mr Bushill-Matthews , the opportunity to pretend to be conciliatory by accepting the content of the note , but nothing more .
I want the European delegation &apos;s proposals to gain the support that they deserve in Cancún .
it is important , not only from the point of view of the energy sector , but also for environmental reasons , to modernise public transport , as well as local heating systems , by switching to alternative sources of energy .
in addition , I believe that this whole area must remain an exclusive competence of the Member States .
the problem which arose and was discussed in committee mainly concerned the following : both the Electoral Act of 1976 and the Treaty of Lisbon require Members of this Parliament to be directly elected by the peoples of the various nations .
the situation there has remained unchanged for many years and we know it is a complex and difficult situation that cannot be resolved overnight .
it has been a rather tough process debating this document in Parliament , but I am very pleased that we are able , as Parliament in session , to make our recommendation today with regard to how the Commission &apos;s and Mr Barnier &apos;s work should continue .
of course we need to maintain security in Israel , but the Palestinians should not have to suffer in order to maintain security in Israel .
we are doing it because real peace can only be created when there is justice for the victims - and there are victims not just with Pakistani or Indian passports .
( FI ) Mr President , one in three fatal road accidents in Europe is caused by drunk driving .
at the least we need to make clear what we mean in one or other text , and this is the stage at which we can clearly settle questionable issues .
better use should be made of the opportunity presented by FP7 .
I am equally appalled that the Greens should disagree and promote deletion of sensible wording covering tolerance of prostitution , where it is clear much violence against women occurs .
once more , the right of opinion is violated under the pretext of security .
the creation of a fund to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives is especially important , even with a small initial endowment of EUR 146 million .
so , in relation to the &apos; pesticides package &apos; - unlike the REACH directive - the Members of this House will not allow themselves to be discredited .
I also consider the decision of the Tabling Office regarding the inadmissibility of the proposal without giving any reasons to be unacceptable , scandalous and somewhat erroneous .
Mr President , I take this opportunity of wishing well the east European cities in the coming of the very early skiing season , with the snow and ice that have come there .
we are prepared to fight for this .
the ball is therefore back in the Council &apos;s court .
just recently , we heard about border control between Bulgaria and Ukraine , where Bulgarian border officials had been bribed to allow people through the external borders of the European Union that have no business being here .
one minute of speaking time is already very little , and shortening the list is , in my view , also rather arrogant .
I am afraid that , then , we will give a message which will mean a split between the big and small countries , and this will undermine any dream of unity , fairness and inclusion .
( LT ) Ladies and gentlemen , the restructuring of the sugar industry and the changes in the organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are necessary .
I believe that we already know who poses a threat .
it is in this context that we need to know the Council &apos;s position and also monitor its development .
the new European External Action Service could provide an extremely suitable instrument capable of helping anticipate strategic changes in third countries and promote the European agricultural model all over the world .
( it ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this week , we should have approved the European Union General Budget for 2011 .
they also relate to the role of Eurocontrol , which we believe needs to be completely overhauled in order to ensure its good governance and control over the provision of services .
the basis for the European neighbourhood policy is the creation of a climate of trust in the immediate vicinity of the European Union .
I await your single market review , to see how you will drive growth and jobs in difficult terrain , and your legal migration policy , hoping it encompasses the concerns of the countries of origin .
firstly , the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left is against the proposal to establish a new European authority in this area .
the Small Business Charter that has been announced by the Commission is to include these kinds of proposals .
in the opinion of the Committee on Industry , international standards must apply here .
I have noted that the European Union has communicated with Russia officially on the subject .
all over Europe , the young people &apos;s age for entering the labour market has upsettingly increased , at the same time with the decrease in the retirement age .
finally , I would like to say that it has been a pleasure to work with all of you during these years .
its position is quite the contrary , in fact .
this is my answer .
the relationship between church and state
in today &apos;s world , lies and oppression rest on two pillars .
this was also on the agenda of the Defence Ministers &apos; meeting which I chaired last week and which was also attended by NATO Secretary-General Anders Rasmussen .
( SV ) Mr President , as the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament with regard to this matter , I would like to express my thanks to Mr Böge for his positive spirit of cooperation .
